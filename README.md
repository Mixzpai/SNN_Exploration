This project builds upon ideas and example code from **[snnTorch](https://snntorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/tutorial_1.html)**,  
an open-source spiking neural network library maintained by the **UCSC Neuromorphic Computing Group**.

snnTorch was initially developed by **Jason K. Eshraghian** in the **Lu Group (University of Michigan)**,  
with additional contributions from **Vincent Sun**, **Peng Zhou**, **Ridger Zhu**, **Alexander Henkes**,  
**Steven Abreu**, **Xinxin Wang**, **Sreyes Venkatesh**, **gekkom**, and **Emre Neftci**.

My implementation restructured the original tutorial into an object-oriented format to provide  
a more modular and reusable SNN design for experimentation and education.
